     <p1>My favorite color is yellow because it reminds me of the sun. I like eating. I also like music.<br>I love watching movies, especially with my 11th grade lunch squad. However, I hate alien movies, but more on that later.</p1>
    <h2><ins>Dislikes</ins></h2>
    <p1>Alien movies with human ladies giving birth to an octopus alien baby are the worst. Also mushrooms. And okra. <br> When I have dry skin. The SATs. Also probably the ACT. Headaches. When my sister borrows my clothing and "forgets" to return it. <br> Not having any charger available at my house (how is it possible to lose so many chargers???). Being late, although that is a family tradition. When I get really comfortable in bed and am in the perfect position to sleep but realize that I have to pee.</p1>
